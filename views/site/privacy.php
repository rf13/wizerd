            1. 	What Information Is Collected?<br />

            A. 	Personally Identifying Information. To take advantage of certain optional features or functions of the Website, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifying information. Personally identifying information is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your full name, address, or email address), and which we may refer to here as PII. For example, you may be asked to supply your name and email address if you complete the optional registration and/or coupon process for the Site, or if you purchase advertising using our online ad placement service. You can choose not to provide such information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some features of the Site. We do not automatically collect any PII from visitors to the Site. After creating a profile, if you wish to change any of your profile information, you may do so within the "Profile" section. We may also combine information you have otherwise provided to us with PII you submit on the Site.<br />

            
            B.	Children Under the Age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifying information from or about children under the age of 13. By submitting any personally identifying information, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age. If we discover that we have received any information from or about a child under 13 in violation of this statement, we will delete that information. If you believe that we have collected personally identifying information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at the address provided in the "QUESTIONS" section below.<br />

            C. 	Non-Personally Identifying Information<br />

            1.	Cookies. Like many website operators, we sometimes make use of browser "cookies." A "cookie" is a small piece of information that we use to assign each visitor's computer a unique, random numerical identification code that resides in a designated file on your computer. Our cookies do not automatically collect personally identifying information. We may use information collected from cookies to recognize your browser when you visit the Site, to facilitate easy login, to attempt to personalize the Site for each user, to ensure that your browser does or does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads and offers in a series and to track page usage and paths, to help serve advertisements, or to facilitate your ability to navigate the Site. We may link the cookie to PII you submit or other information we collect. Separately, third party companies that serve advertisements on the Site may use cookies and other tracking information, as further detailed below, to collect information about your visits to this Site and other websites.<br />
 
            2.	Log Files. Like most websites, we use tracking programs that collect information about log files, including browser types, internet service providers (ISPs), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, number of clicks, and Internet protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet, which web servers use to identify where to send the information your computer requests. We may use IP addresses for a number of purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners, or to audit the use of the Site. We may disclose such non-personally identifying information, such as aggregated statistics, to third parties for a variety or purposes, including describing our services, marketing, and improving the experiences of visitors to the Site. The information that we collect regarding log files is not linked to personally identifying information.<br />

A web beacon allows the party that set the web beacon to monitor and collect certain limited information about the movements of online Web users. No personally identifying information is collected through web beacons or web bugs. Advertisers on the Site may elect to use third party advertising companies to serve ads on the Site, and they may use such web beacons to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement, in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Advertisers may also place a web beacon to allow them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the same service. We do not control web beacons used by such third parties. <br />

Personally identifying information may also be stored on computers of third parties that provide technical support for the operation of the Site or who otherwise have access to your PII as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
